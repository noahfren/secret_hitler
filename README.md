### About

The purpose of this application is to serve as a replacement for the physical game board and game pieces. This web recreation of the game allows you to play with people who are not physically present. Our aim was to recreate as much of the tabletop experience as possible (via on-screen images, cards, notifications, and action prompts) so that this can be used as a replacement if you do not have the actual game board and pieces, or if you prefer to use a computer.
